# CS50 Learning Repository

This repository contains my solutions and projects that I've undertaken while learning C programming through the [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) course.

## Getting Started

To run any of the C programs:

1. Clone the repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/CS50-learning-repo.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired directory, for example:
    ```
    cd src1w/
    ```

3. Compile the program:
    ```
    clang -o [output-name] [file-name].c
    ```

4. Run the compiled program:
    ```
    ./[output-name]
    ```

## Dependencies

- The CS50 library is often used in these projects. To install it, follow the instructions from the [official CS50 library documentation](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/library/c/).
